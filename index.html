							<h2>A message to my favorite badut</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Happy birthday, my love! You're 21!!! I really believe 2022 is going to be your
								funnest year yet. Think about it, you don't need a fake anymore to go to clubs.
								As you head into a new year of your life, I just wanted to say that I'm so
								blessed to have you in my life. The countless times you've made me laugh, smile,
								and experience pure joy. I hope you like the yellow-y flowers I got you; they
								reminded me of you, since you're like a ray of sunshine in my life. I'm so lucky
								to have you, Sidney Jaury.
							</p>
							<p>To think that all of this started with that Zoom meeting last year and the hackathon;
								I still remember my thoughts when you surprised me when we were walking around IKEA
								in Sentul. You really were an enigma to me; always managing to surprise me in the
								best way possible. Honestly, college really changed after you came into my life.
								You taught me to enjoy life and showed me a new level of happiness I've never experienced
								before. You were my source of joy and continue to be. I always looked forward to
								the weekends with you, and through our ups and downs, I grew to love you more and
								more with each passing moment with you. I love your silliness and your clownliness,
								your smile and your laugh, your quirky habits and your weirdness; I love every version
								of you there is. Please see photo attached below for my fav version (the badut version).
							</p>
							<p>I know you might have some worries as you enter this new year, but I'm here to tell you
								you're larger and stronger than those fears of doubt. I know that you might feel
								pressured by internships or directionless about the future, but knowing you, no
								matter where you go or decide to do, you're going to wow everyone around you. You
								go the extra mile and give 110%, and I just know you're going to succeed at whatever
								you put your heart into. So don't worry. You're Sidney Jaury, and I believe in you
								more than anyone I know.
							</p>
							<p>I love you so much, Sidney... happy birthday!</p>
